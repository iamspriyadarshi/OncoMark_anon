## Datasets

OncoMark leverages an extensive and diverse collection of datasets to train and validate its multi-task learning framework. These datasets span synthetic and real-world transcriptomics data, ensuring robust performance across diverse applications in oncology research.

The data is freely available at [**Dryad**](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.zw3r228jc)

### Synthetic Dataset Generation
We utilized **2.7 million single-cell transcriptomes** from 14 tumor types, collected from 922 patients across 51 studies in the **Weizmann 3CA repository**, to generate synthetic datasets for model training. Key steps include:

1. **Quality Control**:
    - Excluded cells with:
      - Mitochondrial transcript content > 15%.
      - Fewer than 200 or more than 6,000 mRNA transcripts.
    - Curated hallmark-related gene sets from multiple databases, refined through manual literature review.

2. **Hallmark Activity Scoring**:
    - Computed **Digital Scores** for 10 cancer hallmarks using the Mann-Whitney U test.
    - Used **Otsu’s thresholding** for binary classification of hallmark activity.

3. **Synthetic Biopsy Creation**:
    - Aggregated 200 hallmark-specific cells per patient sample.
    - Generated separate synthetic datasets with positive and negative ground truths for robust model training.

4. **Preprocessing**:
    - Transformed data into rank space, followed by **log2-transformation** and standardization (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).

### External Validation Datasets
For external validation, the model was evaluated on synthetic datasets derived from five independent studies:
- **Dong et al. (2020)**, **Yost et al. (2019)**, **Pal et al. (2021)**, **Gao et al. (2021)**, **Nam et al. (2019)**  
   (95 patients in total).

Additionally, bulk transcriptomic data were collected from publicly available real-world datasets, including:

- **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**: 6,679 samples.
- **MET500**: 868 samples.
- **POG570**: 570 samples.
- **Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)**: 1,019 samples.
- **TARGET**: 734 samples.
- **PCAWG**: 1,210 samples.
- **GTEx**: 8,228 normal samples.
- **ENCODE**: 329 normal samples.

These datasets were used to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and generalizability of OncoMark in predicting hallmark activity.

## Model Training

The OncoMark framework is a multi-task neural network designed to predict hallmark activity with high fidelity. Its architecture reflects the complex interdependencies of hallmark activity in tumor biology.

### Model Architecture
![](Oncomark_arch.svg)

 - **Input Layer**:
    - Comprises 9,326 neurons, representing preprocessed gene expression features.

 - **Shared Base Layer**:
    - A dense layer with 64 units and **ReLU activation**, capturing pan-hallmark characteristics.
    - Initialized with the **He uniform initializer** for efficient convergence.

 - **Task-Specific Layers**:
     - Each hallmark task has:
        - A dense layer with 16 units and **ReLU activation** for hallmark-specific feature learning.
        - An output layer with a single neuron and **sigmoid activation** for binary classification.

This architecture outputs probability scores for all 10 hallmark tasks simultaneously. **Binary cross-entropy loss** was computed independently for each task, and a weighted average of these losses ensured balanced learning.

### Training Procedure
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
    - A balanced dataset of **67,930 samples** with hallmark-positive and hallmark-negative samples was used.
    - Training: 57,735 samples (85%).
    - Validation: 10,195 samples (15%).
    - Train-test splits were conducted separately for each hallmark to maintain balanced representation.

2. **Optimization**:
    - **Optimizer**: Adam with a learning rate of 0.0001.
    - **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Reduced learning rate by 0.5 after 3 epochs of no improvement (minimum: 1e-6).
    - **Early Stopping**: Halted training after 6 epochs with no validation improvement.

3. **Epochs**:
    - Training conducted for **50 epochs**. Gains in validation performance became marginal, leading to early termination.

4. **Batching**:
    - Data from all hallmark tasks were merged and shuffled to avoid hallmark-specific biases and ensure uniform exposure.

### Validation and Metrics
 - External validation was conducted on **95 samples** from five independent studies.
 - Key metrics included:
    - **F1 Score**
    - **Accuracy Score**
    - **Precision and Recall**
    - **Balanced Accuracy**
    - **Precision-Recall Curve**
    - **ROC Curve**

These metrics demonstrated OncoMark's ability to generalize effectively across diverse datasets, confirming its robustness and applicability to real-world scenarios.
