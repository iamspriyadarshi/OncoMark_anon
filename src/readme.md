## Description
This folder contains various scripts and notebooks used in the preparation, training, validation, and analysis of the OncoMark model. Below is a detailed description of each file and its purpose:

---

### 1. **`Model_Train_Data_Prep.ipynb`**

* **Purpose**: Prepares and processes training data for model development. This includes feature extraction, label assignment, and dataset formatting.

---

### 2. **`Model_Train_and_Int_Val.ipynb`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Trains the OncoMark model.
  * Performs **five-fold cross-validation repeated twice** to ensure robust and consistent evaluation.

---

### 3. **`Model_Val_Ext_Syn_Data.ipynb`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Prepares five external validation datasets.
  * Runs the trained model on these datasets to generate predictions and evaluate generalizability.

---

### 4. **`Model_Val_Metastasis.ipynb`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Prepares primary site data from two datasets with confirmed metastasis.
  * Validates whether the model correctly identifies **Activation of Invasion and Metastasis** hallmark.

---

### 5. **`Model_Val_Normal_Cancer.ipynb`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Prepares and evaluates the model on six cancer datasets and two normal tissue datasets.
  * Assesses the modelâ€™s ability to differentiate between malignant and normal samples.

---

### 6. **`Model_Comparison.ipynb`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Compares OncoMark model performance against traditional ML models:

    * Logistic Regression
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
    * Support Vector Classification (SVC)
    * Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
    * XGBoost
  * Evaluation conducted on the same datasets used in `Model_Val_Normal_Cancer.ipynb`.

---

### 7. **`MTL.py`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Contains the full implementation of the **OncoMark model architecture**, based on **multi-task learning (MTL)** principles.

---

### 8. **`Drug_Analysis.ipynb`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Performs drug-response correlation analysis using hallmark activity scores.
  * Generates visualizations and results shown in **Figure 5** of the manuscript.

---

### 9. **`Stage_Analysis.ipynb`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Conducts co-association analysis between hallmark activity and **clinical staging** (AJCC/TNM).
  * Results are presented in **Figure 3**.

---

### 10. **`UCELL.R`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Contains code for calculating **hallmark signature scores** using the **UCell** method in R.
  * These scores are used as labels or validation metrics in model training and evaluation.

---

### 11. **`Label_Validation.ipynb`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Validates the **binary labels** assigned to hallmark activity using thresholding techniques.
  * Ensures consistency and biological relevance of the labeling strategy.

---

### 12. **`data_info.R`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Extract Mitochondrial Content and total count to faciliate data filtering.

---

### 13. **`Hallmark_Scoring_scRNASeq.ipynb`**

* **Purpose**:

  * Contains code for calculating **hallmark signature scores** in scRNASeq using the **UCell** method in Python.
